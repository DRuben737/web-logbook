The previous one had a few limitations, such as it couldn't correctly calculate the time if the flight started before sunset and ended after sunrise. Or there was quite a high error if the flight was close to the North or South poles. The new algorithm divides the flight for the segments <1 minute and checks the sunrise/sunset time for each of them, and then summarises the total night time.

## [2.20.3] - 16.04.2023

## [2.20.0] - 13.04.2023

- New: Added airport database synchronization with a mobile app.
- Update: Moved code that calculates a night time from the package to the internal module - easier troubleshooting and it was used as an example for adding the same functionality to the mobile app
- Fix: Remarks in the main logbook table are truncated depends on the screen width.
- Update: New version for the go-nighttime package, which uses a different library for calculating sunrise and sunset. It might not as precise as the previous one (the difference is up to 2 minutes depending on the flight time), but the calculation is much faster (1000 times) and it doesn't need a time zone database, which makes the binary file up to 15MB less.
- Fix: Show values on the charts (tooltip) in the proper format - HH:MM for time fields, and XXX XXX nm for distance

## [2.19.0] - 06.04.2023

- New: Added new setting `Replace SE and ME values for single pilot time with "âœ“" symbol` for PDF export formats. It's according to EASA Part FCL.050 logbook example https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/Part-FCL.pdf

- New: Added Cross Country for the Stats tables

## [2.10.1] - 10.12.2022

- New: a date range field (https://www.daterangepicker.com/) for the logbook, stats, and maps pages with some predefined values (last 30 days, this month etc) and the possibility to select a custom range. This one probably will cause some hidden bugs in UI, but Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯*
- New: Started to write a changelog to track the changes, fixes and so on in one file
- New: Added binaries for arm32 to support older Raspberry Pi devices
- Updated: The custom date picker from jquery was replaced by the date range picker. No effect on the end user, just simplifying the code
