# Changelog

## [2.9.0] - 27.11.2022

### New

- Added a date range field (https://www.daterangepicker.com/) for logbook, stats and maps pages with some predefined values (last 30 days, this month etc) and possibility to select a custom range. This one probably will cause some hidden bugs in UI, but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯*
- The custom date picker from jquery was replaced by the date range picker. No effect on the end user, just simplifying the code
- Started to write a changelog to track the changes, fixes and so on in one file
- Added binaries for arm32 to support older Raspberry Pi devices
